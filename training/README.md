# Train your own OpenCV Haar classifier

This repository aims to provide tools and information on training your own
OpenCV Haar classifier.  Use it in conjunction with this blog post: [Train your own OpenCV Haar
classifier](http://coding-robin.de/2013/07/22/train-your-own-opencv-haar-classifier.html).
- The README comes from https://github.com/mrnugget/opencv-haar-classifier-training

## Instructions

1. Install OpenCV & get OpenCV source

2. Copy this repository to somewhere else

3. Put your positive images (60+) in the `./positive_images` folder and create a list
of them :

        find ./positive_images -iname "*.jpg" > positives.txt

4. Put the negative images (600+) in the `./negative_images` folder and create a list of them:

        find ./negative_images -iname "*.jpg" > negatives.txt

5. Create positive samples with the `bin/createsamples.pl` script and save them
to the `./samples` folder (change the width and height):

        perl bin/createsamples.pl positives.txt negatives.txt samples 1500\
          "opencv_createsamples -bgcolor 0 -bgthresh 0 -maxxangle 1.1\
          -maxyangle 1.1 maxzangle 0.5 -maxidev 40 -w 80 -h 40"

6. Use the compiled executable `mergevec` to merge the samples in `./samples`
into one file:

        find ./samples -name '*.vec' > samples.txt
        ./mergevec samples.txt samples.vec

7. Start training the classifier with `opencv_traincascade`, which comes with
OpenCV, and save the results to `./classifier` (change wid, hei, numPos, numNeg):

        opencv_traincascade -data classifier -vec samples.vec -bg negatives.txt\
          -numStages 20 -minHitRate 0.999 -maxFalseAlarmRate 0.5 -numPos 1000\
          -numNeg 600 -w 80 -h 40 -mode ALL -precalcValBufSize 1024\
          -precalcIdxBufSize 1024

9. Wait until the process is finished (which takes a long time â€” a couple of
days probably, depending on the computer you have and how big your images are).

10. Use your finished classifier!

        cd ~/opencv-2.4.9/samples/c
        chmod +x build_all.sh
        ./build_all.sh
        ./facedetect --cascade="~/finished_classifier.xml"


## Acknowledgements

A huge thanks goes to Naotoshi Seo, who wrote the `mergevec.cpp` and
`createsamples.cpp` tools and released them under the MIT licencse. His notes
on OpenCV Haar training were a huge help. Thank you, Naotoshi!
